I would LOVE if you contact me when looking over or running this application,
it has so many nuances and little details you can tweak to alter the simulation to your
liking, and I would love to show them all to you. 
I can be reached at mrjmoak3@gmail.com, or mrjmoak3@gatech.edu.

I'll try to cover some basic things about it:

By James Allen Moak III

This program simulates the logistics of the theory of evolution. 
Each lifeform has statistics that determine its behavior.
Upon creation, the lifeform's statistics can vary randomly from that of the parent's statistics.
The white hollow squares are Eggs.
The brown solid squares are Food.
The jelly-fish-like moving things are the lifeforms. 

Upon contacting 'food' the lifeform will eat it. The food is used to sustain itself,
as well as producing offspring.
Offspring's traits differ from their parents slightly, using a simple algorithm.

Press Escape to exit the program.
Use the mouse's scroll wheel to zoom in and out.
Left-Click a lifeform to get it's stats.
Right-Click a lifeform to 'follow' it.
Use the left and right arrow keys to fast-forward or slow down time

*WARNING*: fast forwarding will effect the stability of the program.
If lifeforms are moving at high speeds with a low framerate, errors in the sim WILL occur!

I have been working on and off on this project since Junior year of High School, and I 
love talking about it, so feel more than free to contact me if you have any questions.
